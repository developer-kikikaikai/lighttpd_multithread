##To know why lighttpd is so fast.

I always I wonder "how fast lighttpd run, but it's a single thread".
To solve my question, I want to try to modify lighttpd 1.4.49 with multi thread, and compare both specs.
This is only to upgrade my skill, know about good points of it,
and to develop sample "design_pattern_for_c" libraries packages(https://github.com/developer-kikikaikai/design_pattern_for_c).
